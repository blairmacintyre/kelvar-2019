_The goal is to provide real studio design learning experiences in STEM classes by displaying examples of the students' work on the walls, tables, floors and other surfaces using Augmented Reality (AR) technologies._

## Two Practices from the Studio Model <br> for learning

<div class="column-container">

<div class="column">
<h3><span class="green">Pin-ups</span></h3>
Students pin their work on a <br>wall, and the teacher and<br> students walk around the room<br> commenting on the pinned-up work
</div>

<div class="column">
<h3><span class="green">Meet-ups</span></h3>
Students working together in a <br>studio can look at others work and<br> this encourages community and <br>collaborative learning

## Methodology

Spring ‘16 semester we observed two CS 1315 Intro to media computation recitations<br>
_(observations and interviews with students, instructors)_
<br><br><br>
One recitation modeled after a studio: <br>
students’ work projected onto the walls in real time<br>
_(12 students, 1 professor, 1 undergrad instructor)_
<br><br>
The other recitation run without the studio design and taught more traditionally<br>
_(50+ students, 2 undergrad instructors)_

From an interview with a studio:   
_“I liked it alot. It projects like the last image someone produced. You could see who had already, liked, fully understood the topic and, like, who had completed the task and then you could ask them for help if you needed too, or people who are struggling you could help them.”_

Feedback from the Instructor: 
_“The technology allowed me to shift the focus of attention to the students, and away from the teacher's screen. Every student was doing something interesting, and students could get a sense of the range of possibilities by just looking around them.”_

# Implications

_Changing the culture of the classroom is difficult!_
- A teacher could grant permission to allow students to <br>interact with one another and to interact with the “pins.” 
- Training teachers to integrate the technology into their <br>classroom practices
- Students need help to learn how to critique and to<br> figure out what questions to ask.
